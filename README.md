What is VR?

Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that uses pose tracking and 3D near-eye displays to give the user an immersive feel of a virtual world. Virtual reality has applications in entertainment (particularly video games), education (such as medical or military training), and business (such as virtual meetings). Other types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, which are sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR, though definitions are changing due to the industry's infancy.
What is VR in Surgical Training?
An developing technology called virtual reality (VR) allows surgeons to learn new techniques and assess their degree of proficiency prior to doing surgery on patients. Additionally, VR enables the student to come back to the same process or job multiple times for a refresher session. This could help people in practicing more and more without the help of physical or real bodies. This helps in learning more with less resources. Bieng portable, you can practice on a VR anywhere,and not necessary to be in a clinical setting. Participants in the VR group scored much higher than those in the traditionally trained group across the board, as determined by the Global Assessment Five-Point Rating Scale, with a 230% increase in the overall score. The process was finished on average 20% more quickly by VR-trained participants than by those who received standard training. Additionally, they properly completed 38% more of the steps on the procedure-specific checklist. There was statistical significance for both results.
At the 2019 Annual Meeting of the Western Orthopedic Association, we presented the findings of the unpublished study "Randomized, Controlled Trial of a Virtual Reality Tool to Teach Surgical Technique for Tibial Shaft Fracture Intramedullary Nailing." To learn more about how VR affects patient outcomes and lowers costs by enhancing surgical efficiency, long-term longitudinal research are required.
There are many kinds of surgeries that can be more efficiently done with the help of VR. A new surgical technique called laparoscopic surgery necessitates learning new skills and needs the surgeon to watch the procedure on a video display. VR simulation could mimic the actual working environment, enhancing training and obviating the need for pricey animal training models. We have the technology to create a real-time VR learning environment for surgeons and to simulate tissues and laparoscopic equipment, according to our preliminary experience. Assessing competency is another fundamental need. Surgery training is an apprenticeship that takes 5-7 years to complete under close supervision. Technical proficiency is evaluated subjectively by the mentor. Quantitative assessment of proficiency is required if VR surgical simulators are to play a significant role in the future.

BENEFITS OF VR AND AR IN SURGERY

3D anatomical images and models are available.
Real-time access to medical references and information.
Reduces the time it takes to prepare for a surgical procedure.
Low-risk surgical testing environments are available.
Reduces the cost of surgical equipment and personnel.
